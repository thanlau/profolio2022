My strongest research area is in machine learning, with a specific focus on classification and detection problems. This includes working on attack detection and the development of advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) to efficiently generate adversarial examples for the adversarial training. My work primarily uses feature engineering and data quality improvement techniques.
